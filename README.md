# pi-music
Using the `pyo` module, this script computationally generates music from the digits of pi.  Each digit is mapped to the notes forming a C Major scale - the values 0-9 are mapped to the frequencies of C4 through E5 as shown in the chart below.  Using `pyo`'s ADSR envelope, the timbre of the sound can be customized.
